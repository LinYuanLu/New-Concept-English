- none of 加可数或不可数名词作主语时,谓语动词用法

##### none of加可数或不可数名词作主语时,谓语动词用法

当none of后为接可数名词(三人/物或以上)并且在句子中做主语,其谓语动词一般用复数*(即使可以用单数),*

但是如果为不可数名词,那么谓语动词只能用单数

```
None of them have/has discovered the problem.   他们中没有一个人发现这个问题

None of the water was pure.  这些水都不是纯净的
```

rot away   腐烂殆尽

Main knowledge

- 关系从句

##### 关系从句

```markdown
1981 was the year when my daughter was born.   
**这里的where是关系副词,它代替了本应该是关系代词的that**
试比较:
1981 was the year that my daughter was born. 

This is the place where I grew up.   
**同样,此处where代替了关系代词that**

That's the reason why he dislikes us. 
**why代替了that/which**
```

这些关系副词同样可以用于非限定性关系从句,应注意的是,如果非限定性定语从句用的是关系副词,那么就可以用that替代.  *(不如看下面的句子,如果能理解的话,建议不要死记语法,这样可能会降低自己对英语的兴趣)*

```
1981, the year when/that my daughter was born, was the happiest year for me. 

The small town, the place where/that I grew up, has been a famous tourist attraction. 
```

##### normal和ordinary的区别

normal和ordinary都表示正常的,但是ordinary经常用来形容人等有生命的物体

```markdown
I want a nomal size suit please.
